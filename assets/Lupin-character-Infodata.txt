Fujiko Mine (峰 不二子)
Age: 20s - early 30s
Birthday: 7 June (The Castle of Cagliostro)
Height: 167 cm
Weight: 50 kg

Fujiko is Lupin's love (or lust) interest. Fujiko is an extremely intelligent and crafty person and will use her feminine charms to get what she wants from any man. She is also an expert when it comes to firearms and even rivals Lupin when it comes to her burglary skills. Lupin and Fujiko were never really lovers although occasionally Lupin scored with Fujiko, especially when the latter is dying to find out about a particular detail that Lupin knows. She will also routinely make deals with Zenigata or Lupin's current enemy in an attempt to gain her freedom or to hopefully gain a piece of the loot he is after. While Lupin normally is able to outsmart Fujiko, she is able to make off with some or all of his loot on occasion. She doesn't like frogs.

Goemon Ishikawa XIII (石川 五ェ門)
Age: Mid-20s - early 30s
Birthday: 16 August (The Castle of Cagliostro)
Height: 180 cm
Weight: 63 kg

The thirteenth generation of renegade samurai, beginning with the legendary figure Ishikawa Goemon (石川 五右衛門). He has a sword called Zantetsuken (斬鉄剣), meaning "iron-cutting sword", which can cut through almost anything. In one episode during the TV series Goemon admitted that his sword cannot cut konnyaku, which is a starch-based jelly made from yams, because the blade just gets stuck in it. The Zantetsuken is usually used to cut inanimate objects, which Goemon considers unworthy of his blade and often mutters his catchphrase "once again, I have cut a worthless object" after doing so. Objects cut by Zantetsuken will fall apart a couple of seconds after he sweeps through them with his blade. He is usually quiet and participates in Lupin's exploits less frequently than Jigen. He is also a skilled pilot.

Daisuke Jigen (次元 大介)
Age: Late 20s - early 30s
Birthday: 29 November (The Castle of Cagliostro)
Height: 178 cm
Weight: 70 kg

He is a smooth gunman who is most seen accompanying Lupin in his endeavors and heists. Despite Jigen disliking Lupin's lust for women, to the end he remains Lupin's loyal and reliable marksman.

He can perform a 0.3-second quick-draw and shoots with amazing accuracy. He prefers to conceal his eyes using his hat, as it gives him a more enigmatic appearance. His hat is also an important element to his dead shot accuracy because he uses it for aiming and target acquisition. He is also proficient in the use of many different firearms, such as machine guns, sniper rifles, and even a PTRS anti-tank rifle. Daisuke is also a skilled driver and pilot.

Arsene Lupin III (ルパン三世)
Age: Late 20s - early 30s
Birthday: 10 February (The Castle of Cagliostro)
Height: 179 cm
Weight: 63 kg

Arsene Lupin III is the grandson of Arsène Lupin. He is the world's most wanted thief. Often in his adventures, he takes it upon himself and his gang to foil other criminals engaged in more serious crimes. He sometimes appears incompetent, but mostly as a charade to catch his opponents off guard. While he has been arrested and thrown in jail on several occasions, he has always managed to break out. His infatuation with Fujiko Mine is perhaps his biggest weakness, as it often lands him in undesirable situations.

Age: Late 40s - mid-50s
Birthday: 5 April (The Castle of Cagliostro); 25 December 1938 (Bye Bye Lady Liberty)
Height: 181 cm
Weight: 73 kg

Inspector Zenigata hails from Japan, city of origin unknown. According to Episode 0: First Contact, his original title was Tokyo Police Inspector whose original interest was the capture of Fujiko Mine and her then partner. His pursuit took him to New York where he met Arsene Lupin III for the first time. The master thief's cocky attitude and talents left the inspector infuriated to the point where he left the Japanese Police Force in favor of enlisting in ICPO (called Interpol in Pioneer's English dub) for the sake of specifically bringing Lupin to justice.
