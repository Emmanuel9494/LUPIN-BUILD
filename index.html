    He is a smooth gunman who is most seen accompanying Lupin in his endeavors and heists. 
    Despite Jigen disliking Lupin's lust for women, to the end he remains Lupin's loyal and reliable marksman.
    He can perform a 0.3-second quick-draw and shoots with amazing accuracy.
     He prefers to conceal his eyes using his hat, as it gives him a more enigmatic appearance.

      Fujiko is Lupin's love (or lust) interest. 
      She is also an expert when it comes to firearms and even rivals Lupin when 
      it comes to her burglary skills. Lupin and Fujiko were never really lovers although 
      occasionally Lupin scored with Fujiko, especially when the latter is dying to find out about a 
      particular detail that Lupin knows.
